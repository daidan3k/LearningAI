# 🧠 Learning AI – My Personal Journey

Hey there! 👋
This repo is where I’m keeping track of my progress as I learn about AI and machine learning. It’s a mix of projects I’ve built, courses I’ve taken, and things I’ve found interesting or challenging along the way.

## 🧪 Projects & Experiments

You can check out some of the things I’ve built in the [`models/`](https://github.com/daidan3k/LearningAI/tree/main/models) folder. These are little experiments and practice models that I’ve worked on.

➡️ **One I’m especially proud of:**
[Digit Recognition – Try it live](https://daidan3k-digitrecon.streamlit.app/)

## 📚 Courses I'm Following

All the code, notes, and exercises from courses I'm doing are in the [`courses/`](https://github.com/daidan3k/LearningAI/tree/main/courses) folder.

🎥 **Right now, I’m going through:**
[Daniel Bourke’s PyTorch course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A&list=PLaliG-fEWQsa7W3y2LpM214kq428vc90V&index=16)

## 🔄 Still Learning

This is all a work in progress. I’m not an expert—just someone curious and trying things out. I’ll keep updating this repo as I move forward, mess up, learn, and (hopefully) improve.

Thanks for stopping by!
